We conduct a fifty-year followup of an episode in which such constraints would have been plausibly relaxed by a random allocation of wealth to families. We track descendants of those eligible to win in Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832, which had nearly universal participation among adult white males. Winners received close to the median level of wealth - a large financial windfall orthogonal to parents' underlying characteristics that might have also affected their children's human capital. Although winners had slightly more children than non-winners, they did not send them to school more. Sons of winners have no better adult outcomes (wealth, income, literacy) than the sons of non-winners, and winners' grandchildren do not have higher literacy or school attendance than non-winners' grandchildren. This suggests only a limited role for family financial resources in the transmission of human capital across generations and a potentially more important role for other factors that persist through family lines.},

Our approach is shown to have accuracy, recall, and precision above 90 percent.

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Despite some recent innovations, much empirical work continues to rely on measures of ``average'' or ``non-upper tail'' human capital such as literacy and years of schooling. We thus turn to perhaps unique sources from Denmark and Norway. From the early nineteenth century until after the Second World War, these countries had the tradition of publishing biographies of all high school graduates, usually 25 and 50 years after graduation. These were effectively mini-CVs covering entire careers, including work positions, travel, achievements, and more. We discuss these sources and their potential for furthering our understanding of the role of upper tail knowledge and human capital for development. Source criticism reveals strengths and weaknesses, but importantly confirms promising perspectives for improving the measurement of upper tail knowledge.},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores occupations and skills in the Swedish labor markets during the industrial breakthrough. It encompasses an introduction and four research papers, each addressing issues related to how technological change shapes labor markets. The first and second papers focus on occupational structure and skills, covering all sectors of the economy. The third of fourth papers delve into specific technologies within manufacturing, namely steam and electricity. The first paper conducts an explorative study of the Swedish labor markets between 1870 and 1930. By employing tabulated population censuses and utilizing the HISCLASS scheme for skill classification, I demonstrate that, at the aggregate level, the Swedish population indeed shifted from unskilled to more-skilled occupations. Occupational upgrading was notably more pronounced for women compared to men, with a significant number of women leaving agriculture for skilled service jobs. Within the manufacturing sector, employment shifted from medium-skilled to low- and unskilled occupations. Thus, I propose that the shift from agriculture to services played a more important role in the aggregate skill upgrading in Sweden than the shift from agriculture to industry. The second paper investigates how industrialization and technological change impact the skill premium. Using income tax registry data to construct a series of occupational incomes between 1900 and 1950, the study challenges the expectation of a rising skill premium associated with skill-biased technologies like electricity. Despite rapid technological change, the skill premium decreased, largely because of the faster income growth of low- and unskilled production workers compared to high- and medium-skilled white-collar workers. In the third paper, in collaboration with Svante Prado and Yoshihiro Sato, we explore the association between mechanization and female and child employment. Drawing on an establishment-level survey from 1879, we show that establishment size is positively associated with the employment of women and children, and that the effect of mechanization is likely mediated through establishment size.  Finally, the fourth paper, co-authored by Svante Prado, shows that the widespread electrification of Swedish industry was in general positive for labor. Using establishment-level data from industrial surveys, we show that electricity use is positively associated with higher employment and wages. Furthermore, establishments that adopted electricity during our study period increased their employment and wages more rapidly than those that did not adopt electricity.},

  abstract = {Was technological progress during and after the Industrial Revolution top-down or bottom-up? The technology that created the great inventions was driven by a combination of pathbreaking ideas and the dexterity and skills of trained artisans. While those forms of human capital were quite different, they both came out of small elites of intellectuals and craftsmen, what are rapidly becoming known as ``upper-tail human capital.'' I analyze the institutions that drove the incentives for both, and show that they came together to produce the Great Enrichment. These incentives were both material and social: between 1500 and 1700, the search for financial security and reputation cooperated in producing a unique institutional environment in which the elites in Western Europe produced the three legged-stool of European modernity: the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. Once these three movements had succeeded, the foundation for modern economic growth had been laid.},

Exploiting that proximity to hydropowered plants shaped the electricity network independently of previous local conditions, we estimate the impact of electricity on labor strikes. Our results indicate that electricity adoption preceded an increase in conflicts, but strikes were of an offensive nature and most common in sectors with increasing labor demand. This suggests that electrification provided workers with a stronger bargaining position from which they could voice their claims.},

In our experiment, a third of the houses in a town were covered by lava. People living in these houses were much more likely to move away permanently. For the dependents in a household (children), our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the ``lava shock'' dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The benefits of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not flow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town. We interpret our findings as evidence of the importance of comparative advantage: the gains to moving may be very large for those badly matched to the location they happened to be born in, even if differences in average income are small.},

We first construct a new database of seven million notable individuals (Human Biographical Record). We then measure women's status as women's share among the most prominent fraction of population that allows comparison across time and space. The records show no long-run trend in women's share in recorded history. Historically, women's power has been a side-effect of nepotism: the more important family connections, the higher the women's share. But self-made women began to rise among the writers in the 17th century before a broader take off started with the 1800 birth cohort: first among artists and scholars, followed by elected politicians, and finally appointed politicians. The first wave among writers emerged when informal humanist education and new public spheres shaped a supply of literary women, who met the demand of a new female reading public. A strong writer wave predicts a stronger takeoff of self-made women in the 19th century. This effect has persisted and created cross-country divergence.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces layoutparser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications. The core layoutparser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, layoutparser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization pipelines. We demonstrate that layoutparser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io/.},
