## Motivation

1. Electrification is a cannonical example of a **General Purpose Technology (GPT)**

2. When this new technology was adopted in Sweden:

    - It made individuals richer
    - It lowered inequality
    - It allowed structural change on the labour market 

2. What we want to know next:

    - Who were the innovators or adopters?
    - Did they move to opportunity?
    - How much training did they have in the new technology?

## What I want you to take away from today as researchers

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
1. NLP tasks that used to be very challenging / time consuming are no longer!

2. We can use the OpenAI API to structure data from free text at very low cost.

3. It is a General Purpose Technology that can both process data and also inform our workflow as researchers.

## New technology with rapid adoption in Sweden

## What happened to early electrifiers in Sweden?

![](assets/grid_rollout.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## No large unemployment effects in areas who electrified first

![](assets/employment_share.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Incomes were markedly higher in areas that electrified first

![](assets/coef_plot.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Income was shared more equally in areas that electrified first

![](assets/dot_plot.jpeg){fig-align="center"} 

## Now we want to ask:

- Who were the innovators or adopters?
- Did they move to opportunity?
- How much training did they have in the new technology?

## Who is who?

Vem är Vem? is a **Swedish biographical encyclopedia** that was published in two editions of five volumes each in 1945–1950 and 1962–1968 by Bokförlaget Vem är Vem.

The intention was, according to the publishers, to draw attention **to people who were at the height of their activities**, even if they were younger in influential or otherwise noted positions in different areas.

We get biographies and career trajectories of 69448 individuals!

8 of the 10 volumes are digitized by librarians in Uppsala – thank you <3

## How were NLP tasks hard before?

In your case when you use patent data, a lot of the research on historical questions is done just with the title of the patent and relationships between patent holders. It was difficult to get more information from the text of the patent. 

## How are they easy now?

Now we can use the OCR / NLP OpenAI API to get a lot of information from the text of the patent.
