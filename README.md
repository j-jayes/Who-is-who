# Economic History Project: Education and Training in the Swedish Electrification Period

This project examines the extent to which individuals working in electricity-related jobs during the period of electrification in Sweden required less education and training than their colleagues in similar cohorts of non-electricity-related jobs. The data for this research comes from a historical source of biographies on notable Swedes, including information on their education, workplaces, and career roles.

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Ingestion (2 weeks)

- Identify the website(s) and content to be scraped
- Develop a web scraper to extract the relevant biographical information

### 2. Data Processing (3 weeks)

- Translate the biographies from Swedish to English using translation services/APIs
- Process the text data with NLP techniques to identify and structure relevant information
- Convert the processed data into a structured JSON format

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (2 weeks)

- Analyze the structured data to identify trends and patterns
- Visualize the data to get a better understanding of the information

### 4. Regression Analysis (3 weeks)

- Develop a suitable statistical model to test the hypothesis
- Perform regression analysis to answer the research question
- Interpret the results and refine the model if necessary

### 5. Writing the Academic Paper (4 weeks)

- Write an introduction and literature review
- Describe the data, methodology, and results
- Discuss the implications and limitations of the findings
- Edit and revise the paper as needed

## Questions

### How to do occupational classification correctly??

Benchmark on a bunch that we know - from datasets that are hand labelled.

Ask it to suggest many and then take the average? Ask it to do it multiple times and then take the most frequent?
